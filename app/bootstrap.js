/**
 * Created by Javier on 11/23/2014.
 * angular needs to be present on a page before setting up application module,
 * which is required to exist when defining routes config.
 * We use domReady RequireJS plugin to make sure that DOM is ready when we start the app.
 * Note that before doing so weâ€™re loading the app.js dependency, in there the main application is defined.
